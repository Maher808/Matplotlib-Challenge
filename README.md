Summary Statistics for Tumor Volume:

Mean and Median Tumor Volume:

Capomulin and Ramicane exhibit lower mean and median tumor volumes compared to other drugs, indicating potential efficacy in reducing tumor sizes.

Tumor Volume Variance and Standard Deviation:
Lower variance and standard deviation suggest more consistent and potentially effective results with Capomulin and Ramicane in controlling tumor growth.

Standard Error of the Mean:
Capomulin and Ramicane have smaller standard errors, implying more reliable measurements and potentially more accurate representations of their effects on tumor volumes.
